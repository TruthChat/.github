## Who We Are

**TruthChat** is a deep-tech company building enterprise-grade AI infrastructure that transforms how organizations discover, verify, and leverage knowledge from vast document corpora. We operate at the intersection of artificial intelligence, information retrieval, and enterprise software, with a mission to make AI systems more trustworthy, verifiable, and accessible.

We are a **platform company** focused on solving real-world problems for legal, financial, and government sectors in India, where the need for accurate, evidence-based information retrieval is critical for decision-making and compliance.

---

## What We're Building

We develop **intelligent knowledge platforms** that enable organizations to:

- **Transform unstructured information** into searchable, semantically-aware knowledge systems
- **Enable evidence-based decision making** through advanced retrieval and verification capabilities
- **Scale from small document sets to enterprise-level corpora** with consistent performance
- **Bridge the gap between human expertise and AI capabilities** in knowledge-intensive domains

Our solutions address the fundamental challenge of **information discovery at scale**—helping professionals find the right information, at the right time, with the right context, backed by verifiable evidence.

---

## Why It Matters

In an era where information overload is the norm, organizations struggle with:

- **Finding relevant information** in vast document archives
- **Verifying the accuracy and context** of retrieved information
- **Maintaining compliance** with regulatory requirements
- **Scaling knowledge systems** as data volumes grow exponentially

The legal, financial, and government sectors in India face unique challenges:
- **1.5 million lawyers** and thousands of law firms need efficient case law and document research
- **30+ Public Sector Banks** and hundreds of NBFCs require compliance automation and document verification
- **Government and PSUs** are digitizing massive archives under DPI 2.0, creating unprecedented demand for searchable, secure knowledge systems

**TruthChat exists to solve these problems** by building AI infrastructure that doesn't just retrieve information—it provides **certainty through evidence**, enabling professionals to make informed decisions with confidence.
