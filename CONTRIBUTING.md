## Who Can Contribute

Everyone is welcome to contribute! Whether you're:
- A developer writing code
- A user reporting issues
- A technical writer improving documentation
- A designer enhancing user experience
- A researcher sharing insights

...your contributions make a difference.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** you want to contribute to
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Create a branch** for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. **Make your changes** and test them
5. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages
6. **Push to your fork** and open a Pull Request

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Find or Create an Issue

- Check existing issues to see if your idea or bug is already being discussed
- If not, create a new issue describing what you'd like to contribute
- Wait for maintainer feedback before starting major work (for large changes)

### 2. Fork and Branch

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure your code passes existing tests

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
feat: Add support for batch processing
fix: Resolve memory leak in document parser
docs: Update installation instructions
test: Add unit tests for retrieval module
```

**Commit message format:**
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Start with a verb (feat, fix, docs, test, refactor, style, chore)
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Add detailed description if needed (separated by blank line)

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on GitHub with:
- **Clear title** describing the change
- **Detailed description** of what and why
- **Reference to related issues** (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- **Screenshots or examples** if applicable

## Pull Request Guidelines

### What Makes a Good PR

✅ **Clear description** of changes and motivation  
✅ **Small, focused changes** (easier to review)  
✅ **Tests included** for new functionality  
✅ **Documentation updated** if needed  
✅ **Code follows** existing style and patterns  
✅ **No breaking changes** without discussion  

### PR Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (CI/CD, linting, tests)
2. **Code review** by maintainers
3. **Feedback and iterations** (if needed)
4. **Approval and merge** by maintainers

We aim to review PRs within **5-7 business days**. For urgent fixes, please mention it in the PR description.

### Python Code (if applicable)

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and modular

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language

- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Fix typos and improve clarity

## Testing

- **Run existing tests** before submitting: `pytest` or equivalent
